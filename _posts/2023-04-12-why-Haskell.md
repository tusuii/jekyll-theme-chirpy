## What is haskell?

<p style="text-align: justify">
Get ready for a gentle introduction to the world of Haskell! It's a purely functional programming language that makes math nerds blush with joy. Haskell is like the Chuck Norris of programming languages â€“ strong, robust, and committed to immutability. With its tight type system and lazy evaluation strategy, Haskell tackles infinite data structures effortlessly.
</p>

# features of Haskell 
# 1. **Pure Functional:**
<p style="text-align: justify">
Haskell, a statically-typed functional programming language renowned for its robust type system, immutability, and lazy evaluation, holds a prominent place in the programming world. Its origins trace back to the research community in the 1980s, where a team led by Haskell Curry worked on developing a language rooted in mathematical concepts and elegant programming principles. Today, Haskell remains relevant and influential, offering a unique approach to software development that prioritizes correctness, expressiveness, and maintainability.
</p>

```haskell
-- haskell code for fibonacci sequence.

fib :: Int -> Int
fib 0 = 0
fib 1 = 1
fib n = fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
```
```haskell
-- quick sort implementation in haskell.

quicksort :: Ord a => [a] -> [a]
quicksort []     = []
quicksort (x:xs) = quicksort [y | y <- xs, y <= x] ++ [x] ++ quicksort [y | y <- xs, y > x]
```

### Are you mesmerized by the elegance of Haskell's functional programming paradigm? But it has more to offer.


# 2. **Expressive and Concise Syntax:**

<p style="text-align: justify">
Haskell boasts an expressive and concise syntax, allowing developers to craft elegant and readable code. Its syntax promotes a mathematical and declarative style of programming, making it easier to express complex concepts succinctly. Here are two code snippets showcasing Haskell's expressive nature:
</p>

```haskell
-- List Comprehension: generates a list of squares of numbers from 1 to 10.

squares :: [Int]
squares = [x * x | x <- [1..10]]
```
```haskell
-- Function Composition: (.)
-- calculates the total length of strings in a list.

totalLength :: [String] -> Int
totalLength = sum . map length
```
# 3. **Powerful Type System:**
<p style="text-align: justify">
A type system is a set of rules and mechanisms used by a programming language to classify and enforce the types of values that can be used in a program. It provides a way to specify the type of each variable, function, and expression in the code. The type system ensures that operations are used correctly, prevents type errors, and promotes program reliability and safety.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
A type signature, also known as a type annotation, is a declaration that explicitly specifies the type of a variable, function, or expression in a programming language. It is usually written in a specific syntax defined by the language and placed before the name or definition of the entity. A type signature provides documentation and acts as a contract, indicating the expected types of inputs and the resulting type of the output.
</p>

```haskell
-- Safe List Operations: preventing runtime errors that may occur when trying to access the head of an empty list.

safeHead :: [a] -> Maybe a
safeHead []    = Nothing
safeHead (x:_) = Just x
```
```haskell
-- Type-Directed Development:catching type errors at compile-time.

add :: Num a => a -> a -> a
add x y = x + y
```

# 4. **Laziness and Efficiency:**
<p style="text-align: justify">
Haskell employs a lazy evaluation strategy that optimizes resource utilization by computing values only when necessary. This characteristic enhances performance in specific scenarios by avoiding unnecessary computations. 
</p>

### Applications 
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b> Infinite Data Structures: </b> Lazy evaluation allows the creation and manipulation of infinite data structures, such as infinite lists or streams. This capability is beneficial when working with sequences that are too large to store entirely in memory, enabling efficient processing of elements on-the-fly.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Efficient Filtering and Transformation:</b>Lazy evaluation enables efficient filtering and transformation operations on lists. By evaluating elements only when required, unnecessary computations can be avoided, resulting in improved performance for tasks like filtering large datasets or transforming data on-the-fly.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Memoization and Dynamic Programming:</b> Lazy evaluation allows for automatic memoization, where the results of function calls are cached for reuse. This technique is particularly useful in dynamic programming scenarios, where expensive computations can be avoided by lazily evaluating and storing intermediate results.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Lazy I/O:</b> Lazy evaluation enables lazy input/output operations, where data is read or written on demand rather than eagerly. This approach is beneficial for processing large files or streaming data, as only the necessary portions are loaded into memory, reducing memory consumption and improving efficiency.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Concurrency and Parallelism:</b> Lazy evaluation can facilitate concurrent or parallel execution of computations. By evaluating values only when needed, independent computations can run in parallel without unnecessary dependencies, resulting in improved performance and resource utilization.
</p>

```haskell
-- Infinite Lists:Haskell's lazy evaluation ensures that only the required elements are computed when accessed.

fibonacci :: [Integer]
fibonacci = 0 : 1 : zipWith (+) fibonacci (tail fibonacci)
```

```haskell
-- primes list generates an infinite list of prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

primes :: [Integer]
primes = sieve [2..]
  where
    sieve (p:xs) = p : sieve [x | x <- xs, x `mod` p /= 0]
```

# 5. **High-level Abstractions:**
<p style="text-align: justify">
Haskell offers a wide range of high-level abstractions, including monads, type classes, and algebraic data types. These abstractions empower developers to write code that is reusable, composable, and modular, leading to applications that are easier to maintain and extend. 
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Monads for Effects and Composition:</b>
Monads in Haskell, such as the `Maybe` and `IO` monads, provide a powerful mechanism for handling side effects and composing computations. For instance, the `Maybe` monad allows for safe computation in the presence of possible failure, while the `IO` monad enables dealing with input/output operations. By encapsulating effects within monads, developers can write reusable and composable code that abstracts away the complexity of handling side effects.
</p>

```haskell
-- 
safeDivide :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
safeDivide _ 0 = Nothing
safeDivide x y = Just (x `div` y)

example :: Int -> Int -> Maybe Int
example x y = do
  q <- safeDivide x y
  result <- safeDivide (q + 2) 5
  return (result * 10)
```

>Maybe, allows for safe composition of computations that may produce uncertain results or errors. This composability and encapsulation of effects contribute to more robust and maintainable code.

<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Type Classes for Ad hoc Polymorphism:</b>
Type classes in Haskell, such as `Eq`, `Ord`, and `Show`, enable ad hoc polymorphism by defining common behavior for different types. This allows developers to write generic functions that work seamlessly with multiple data types. For example, the `Eq` type class provides the `==` operator, allowing comparisons between values of any type that is an instance of `Eq`. Type classes promote code reuse and extensibility by defining behavior in a modular and flexible way.
</p>

```haskell
-- Eq type class, which provides equality comparison

data Person = Person { name :: String, age :: Int }

instance Eq Person where
  (Person name1 age1) == (Person name2 age2) = name1 == name2 && age1 == age2

areEqual :: Eq a => a -> a -> Bool
areEqual x y = x == y

person1 :: Person
person1 = Person "Alice" 25

person2 :: Person
person2 = Person "Bob" 30

example :: Bool
example = areEqual person1 person2
```
>use of type classes allows us to write generic functions that can operate on different data types as long as they satisfy the required behavior defined by the type class. This ad hoc polymorphism promotes code reuse and flexibility, making it easier to write functions that work seamlessly with various types.
{: .prompt-info }

<p style="text-align: justify">
<b>Algebraic Data Types for Data Modeling:</b>
Algebraic data types, including sum types (e.g., `Either`) and product types (e.g., data declarations), enable developers to model complex data structures. This promotes code clarity, expressiveness, and extensibility. For instance, a data type representing different shapes, such as circles and rectangles, can be defined using algebraic data types. Pattern matching can then be used to handle different cases, making code more readable and maintainable.
</p>

```haskell
-- declared `Shape` data type using algebraic data types.

data Shape = Circle Double | Rectangle Double Double

area :: Shape -> Double
area (Circle radius) = pi * radius * radius
area (Rectangle width height) = width * height

example :: Double
example = area (Circle 5.0)
```

>Algebraic data types allow us to model complex data structures by combining different constructors and associated data. Pattern matching on these constructors enables us to handle different cases and perform operations specific to each case. This promotes code clarity, expressiveness, and extensibility when working with structured data.
