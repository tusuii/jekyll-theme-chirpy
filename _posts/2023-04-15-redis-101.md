# Introduction to Redis:

<div style='text-align: justify;'>
Redis is an open-source, in-memory data structure store that is commonly used as a database, cache, and message broker. It is known for its high performance, versatility, and simplicity. Redis stands for Remote Dictionary Server, and it provides an in-memory key-value store where data is stored primarily in RAM, allowing for fast and efficient data access.
