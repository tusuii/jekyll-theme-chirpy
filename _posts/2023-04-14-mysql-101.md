<p style="text-align: justify, font-size:40px"> 
SQL, or Structured Query Language, is a popular language used for managing and manipulating databases.It provides a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to store, retrieve, update, and delete data.MySQL, on the other hand, is an open-source relational database management system that utilizes SQL as its language for managing databases.language that helps you boss around databases like a pro. It's like having a secret code to store, find, modify, and erase data in a jiffy. And guess what? MySQL is the life of the party, an open-source database management system that loves dancing to the beats of SQL. Together, they make managing databases a wild and enjoyable adventure.

Data Definition Language (DDL) is a set of SQL commands used to define and manage the structure of a database. It allows users to create, modify, and delete database objects such as tables, views, indexes, and constraints. DDL statements are focused on defining the schema and characteristics of the database rather than manipulating the data within it.
</p>

| DDL Statement | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| CREATE       | Creates a new database, table, view, index, or other database object. |
| ALTER        | Modifies the structure of an existing database object, such as adding or dropping columns from a table. |
| DROP         | Deletes a database object, such as a table or index. |
| TRUNCATE     | Removes all data from a table while keeping the table structure intact. |
| RENAME       | Renames a database object, such as renaming a table. |
| COMMENT      | Adds a comment to a database object, providing additional information or descriptions. |
| GRANT        | Grants privileges to users or roles, allowing them to perform specific actions on the database objects. |
| REVOKE       | Revokes privileges from users or roles, removing their ability to perform specific actions on the database objects. |
| SET          | Modifies the session-level or system-level settings for the MySQL server. |
| SHOW         | Retrieves information about the database objects, server status, or configuration settings. |

### **Granting and revoking user privileges**

```sql
granting permissions

--Grant SELECT privilege on the "products" table to a user:
GRANT SELECT ON mystore.products TO 'myuser'@'localhost';

-- Grant INSERT and UPDATE privileges on the "customers" table to a user:
GRANT INSERT, UPDATE ON mystore.customers TO 'myuser'@'localhost';

-- Grant ALL privileges on all tables in the "mystore" database to a user:
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON mystore.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';

Revoking Privileges:

--Revoke SELECT privilege on the "products" table from a user:
REVOKE SELECT ON mystore.products FROM 'myuser'@'localhost';

--Revoke INSERT and UPDATE privileges on the "customers" table from a user:
REVOKE INSERT, UPDATE ON mystore.customers FROM 'myuser'@'localhost';

--Revoke ALL privileges on all tables in the "mystore" database from a user:
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES ON mystore.* FROM 'myuser'@'localhost';
```

### **Managing user accounts and authentication**

```sql
--Create a new user account:
CREATE USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypassword';

--Grant privileges to the user:
GRANT SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE ON mystore.* TO 'myuser'@'localhost';

--Modify user account attributes:
ALTER USER 'myuser'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'newpassword';

--Remove a user account:
DROP USER 'myuser'@'localhost';

--Set password for a user account:
SET PASSWORD FOR 'myuser'@'localhost' = PASSWORD('newpassword');

--View user account privileges:
SHOW GRANTS FOR 'myuser'@'localhost';
```

## **6.Data Integrity and Constraints:**

<p style="text-align: justify">
Data integrity and constraints play a crucial role in maintaining the quality and consistency of data in MySQL databases. They help enforce rules and restrictions on the data stored in tables. Here are some commonly used data integrity constraints in MySQL
</p>
  
| Constraint             | Description                                                                                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Primary Key            | Ensures the uniqueness and non-nullability of a column or a combination of columns.                             |
| Foreign Key            | Establishes a relationship between two tables by enforcing referential integrity.                                |
| Unique                 | Ensures that values in a column or a combination of columns are unique.                                         |
| Not Null               | Ensures that a column does not contain NULL values.                                                              |
| Check                  | Defines a condition that must be satisfied for data in a column.                                                 |
| Default                | Specifies a default value for a column when no explicit value is provided.                                       |

```sql
-- Primary Key Constraint:
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  department_id INT
);

--Foreign Key Constraint:
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);

--Unique Constraint:
CREATE TABLE products (
  product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  product_name VARCHAR(50),
  sku VARCHAR(20) UNIQUE
);

--Not Null Constraint:
CREATE TABLE customers (
  customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

--Check Constraint:
CREATE TABLE employees (
  employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  employee_name VARCHAR(50),
  salary DECIMAL(10, 2),
  CONSTRAINT chk_salary CHECK (salary >= 0)
);

--Default Constraint:
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_date DATE DEFAULT CURRENT_DATE
);
```
  
### **Cascading actions**

<p style="text-align: justify">
cascading actions refer to the automatic propagation of changes across related tables when a primary key or foreign key constraint is defined. There are three cascading actions available: CASCADE, SET NULL, and SET DEFAULT. Here's a brief explanation of each action:
</p>

CASCADE: When a record is updated or deleted in the parent table (referenced table), the corresponding records in the child table (referencing table) are also updated or deleted automatically.

SET NULL: When a record is updated or deleted in the parent table, the foreign key values in the child table are set to NULL. This assumes that the foreign key column allows NULL values.

SET DEFAULT: When a record is updated or deleted in the parent table, the foreign key values in the child table are set to their default values. The default value must be specified when defining the foreign key column.
 
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  customer_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  FOREIGN KEY (customer_id)
    REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE order_items (
  item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  order_id INT,
  product_id INT,
  quantity INT,
  FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
    REFERENCES orders(order_id)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```
