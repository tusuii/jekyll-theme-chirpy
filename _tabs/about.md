<h1 style="text-align: center;">Introduction</h1>

## Hello Friend, This is my corner of the internet.
<p style="text-align: justify">
As a person who is pursuing MSc in Computer Science and has a deep passion for technology and its applications, I have always been fascinated by the limitless possibilities that computers offer. Throughout my academic and professional journey, I have developed a strong love for computers and the impact they have on our world.

<p style="text-align: justify">
Being a computer enthusiast, I have a great deal of intrest and knowledge in programming, algorithms, and software engineering. I am well-versed in a variety of programming languages, including Linux, and I am always eager to learn more about the latest advancements in computer science.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
In addition to my love for computers, I am also an avid follower of the free and open-source software (FOSS) movement. I strongly believe in the importance of FOSS and the role it plays in promoting innovation and collaboration in the technology community. I believe that access to knowledge and information should be a basic human right, and FOSS provides a way to make this a reality.

As someone who is passionate and hardworking, I am constantly seeking new and innovative ways to integrate technology and art. I believe that the intersection of these two fields holds great potential for creative expression and problem-solving. I am always looking for new and exciting ways to merge the two and push the boundaries of what is possible.

<p style="text-align: justify">
In my personal life, I am a minimalist who values simplicity and efficiency. I believe that having less material possessions frees up time and energy for the things that truly matter, such as relationships and experiences. This approach also extends to my work, where I focus on finding simple and elegant solutions to complex problems.
</p>


<p style="text-align: justify">
Lastly, I am a loyal and dependable person who always strives to do my best. Whether it is in my professional or personal life, I take my responsibilities seriously and always try to live up to the expectations of those around me.
